# MySQL-DISPLAYER
While writing mysql we sometimes make some mistakes but don't want to capture done in screenshots so need to edit the photos a bit .
So now to get rid of all the additional job just work in your mysql shell ,after the work is done copy everything from top-left of shell>edits and paste it in a text file .
You can now do whatever changes you want in that file .
Then at last to get the black background with white text on it copy this batch file next to the text file , execute the program in which you have to write the name of text file and voila!! you have a perfect copy of mysql statement just mistakes free.
